  {
    question: "How is this different from a chatbot or AI assistant?",
    answer:
      "Chatbots and assistants require you to prompt them for every task. ClawOps workers are preconfigured automation systems — they don't wait for you to ask. They're connected to your tools, run on schedules or triggers, and handle real operational workflows: research pipelines, support queues, content operations, ops tasks. Think digital employees, not chatbots.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'running in my apps' actually mean?",
    answer:
      "Workers are deployed as chat-based interfaces inside Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, or Slack — the apps your team already uses. You message the worker like a colleague: 'Find me 10 prospects in the SaaS space' or 'Summarize this week's support tickets.' The worker operates using browser automation, API calls, and webhooks behind the scenes.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be tech-savvy?",
    answer:
      "Not at all. ClawOps is designed for founders, operations managers, and teams — not developers. You don't need to write code, manage prompts, or handle infrastructure. We take care of the entire setup and integration.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to get started?",
    answer:
      "Your VPS is provisioned and your first agent is live in 3 minutes. Pre-built integrations connect in minutes. No strategy call needed unless you want one.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you need access to my sensitive data?",
    answer:
      "We follow strict security protocols. Agents only access the specific data streams needed for their tasks. We leverage secure, enterprise-grade infrastructure and can support custom VPC or data-residency requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I use tools without APIs?",
    answer:
      "We have you covered. Our agents use Virtual Chrome — real browser automation that lets them interact with any web-based application, even if it lacks a formal API or integration, just like a human team member would.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this only for agencies?",
    answer:
      "No. While agencies were our starting point, ClawOps is built for any business that runs on workflows: service businesses, SaaS companies, e-commerce operations, consulting firms, and automation-heavy teams. If you have repeatable work that should be automated, a worker can handle it.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if the worker makes a mistake?",
    answer:
      "Workers are configured with guardrails and escalation paths. For support agents, unresolved issues get routed to a human. For data-sensitive tasks, workers surface confidence scores and flag anomalies. We monitor performance continuously and optimize over time.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I start with one worker and expand?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Most clients start with one high-impact role — typically a support, research, or ops worker — and expand once they see results. There's no minimum commitment. You can add roles as your operations scale.",
  },
